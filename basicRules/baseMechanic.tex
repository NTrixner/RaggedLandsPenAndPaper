\section{The Meta Mechanic}\label{sec:metaMechanic}
At the beginning of a scene, the GM describes the scene, as well as any points of interest.
The Players then decide what their player characters want to do.
These actions are then adjudicated.
After actions are adjudicated, the scene has changed and the GM describes the changed scene, or the next scene.

\subsection{Action Adjudication}\label{subsec:actionAdjudication}
Whenever an action happens, it is adjudicated.
The GM decides two things: A) Can the action succeed.
If the action is impossible to succeed, the GM should usually tell the Player.
B) Can the action fail.
If an action can not fail, there is no need to make a roll.\\
If an action is both possible to fail as well as possible to succeed, a character must make an appropriate check.
Most of these checks are Attribute Checks, as described in the next section.\\


\section{Attribute Checks}\label{sec:attributeChecks}
Every check is solved by a roll of a D20 You add a specific modifier to your roll, and maybe get additional bonuses if you're trained in that specific task.
Whenever you roll a check, you compare the outcome of your roll to a Difficulty Value (DV).
If your roll beats that DV, you are able to perform that task.
If your value is lower than the DV, you can not perform the task.
If your roll value and the DV are equal, you roll again.

\subsection{Contests}\label{subsec:contests}
Sometimes, two people compete in a task.
In order to get the outcome, both people roll a D20 and add their relative modifiers, and optional additional dice.
The one with the higher result wins the contest.
If both rolls are the same, they are rolled again until they are not the same anymore.

\subsection{Helping Others and working together}\label{subsec:helping}
Sometimes, a character may be able to help another character with a difficult task.
In such a case, the player describes how exactly they are helping, and the GM adjudicates if it's one of three general scenarios.\\
\textbf{Guided acting} occurs if one character tells another character what to do in order to achieve a task.
In this case, the acting character may +2 to the roll for every level of Skill Proficiency Perk that the guiding character has for said task.\\
For example, a character who is trained in picking locks explaining a different character how to pick a certain lock while the second character is actively doing it might give the lock picker +4 bonus if they have 2 levels in the "Lockpicking" perk.\\
\textbf{Direct Help} If a character helps another character directly in a certain task, the helping character may have to roll for the specific way in which they are helping.
If they succeed, the Difficulty Value of the original task is reduced.\\
For example, if a character is failing their check to climb a cliff, another character who is already at the top might reach down and help them up.
In this case, a strength check might be required from the helper, and would ease the climbing check for the failing character.\\
\textbf{Working together} If two or more characters are working together, every character makes a roll.
Depending on the nature of the task, either the group succeeds if one of them succeeds, or the group fails if one of them fails.\\
Depending on the task, working together might change the DV of the given task.\\
For example, a group of people sneaking past a monster might fail if one of them fails their check.
It might also make it more difficult to sneak past a monster as a group.
However, a group of people pushing against a rock to move it might succeed if only one of the group succeeds, and the DV would probably be lowered.

\subsection{Retries}\label{subsec:retries}
In the RLP, rolls also determine ability, not (just) luck.
If your character tries to disarm a trap, jump a certain distance or wants to climb a wall, your roll doesn't determine how your character performs at that task at this moment, it determines if your character is able to perform that task under the current set of circumstances.
This means, that unless the circumstances change, the outcome of the roll is fixed.
Retries are not an option.
If a character rolls to climb a wall and the roll determines they are not able to climb that wall, the characters have to find another way, maybe by using ropes or finding another spot to climb it.
If the circumstances change, rolls can be retried.
This can mean stress, new knowledge, new abilities or a changed environment.
A character not able to jump a chasm may just be able to do it if he's chased by a Giant Monitor Lizard.
A character who once failed to pick a lock may have learned something new about this type of lock from a book or his mentor, and that might give him the edge to pick it.
A character who wasn't able to lift up a rock may have trained for some weeks and have gotten stronger.
A character who wasn't able to climb the wall last night when it rained, may be able to do it in daylight, when the wall is dry.


\section{Rounding}\label{sec:rounding}
Since this System is written for experienced Tabletop-RPG players, there are a lot of formulas and straightforward calculations.
Even though it's noted everywhere, as a general rule, every time a division happens and the result would be a fraction when an integer is needed, you should round up.

\section{Modifiers Types}\label{sec:modifierTypes}
When modifiers are applied to bonuses and maluses, they usually have a type associated with them.
For example, a strength potion might give a character a temporary "alchemical" bonus to strength.
In general, a creature only profits the strongest bonus of a given type, and only suffers the strongest malus of a given type, but different types of bonuses and maluses are summed up.
For example, a creature might gain a +2 Alchemical Strength bonus and a +3 Magical Strength bonus, gaining a total of a +5 to Strength.
However, if the same creature gains a second Alchemical Strength bonus with +4, the total bonus comes to +7, not +9, since the creature stops profiting from the +2 Alchemical Strength bonus (While still having it - if the +4 bonus ends earlier, the total goes back to +5).
On the other end of the spectrum, a creature suffering a -5 Magical Strength Malus and a -2 Magical Strength Malus would only suffer a total of -5.

\section{Example DVs}\label{sec:exampleDVs}
Here is a list of example difficulty values.
These are designed for a standard group of beginner adventurers.
If the DV is set by something or someone that is trained in what they are doing, you might add the respective level to that DV.
For example, a trap set by someone of average skill might have a Difficulty Value of 13.
However, the same trap made by someone who is skilled at trap-making might be closer to 15, if that trap-maker has a crafting level of 2.
If such a trap would be made by someone who is well-trained too, the Difficulty Value might even increase to something in the range of 16--19.
Circumstantial bonuses might increase or decrease a DV by 1 to 10.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Very easy: 3\\
    These checks are usually not necessary, unless there's significant circumstantial hindrances.
    \item Easy: 8\\
    Most characters should be able to succeed on these checks.
    Trained characters will almost always succeed on these checks.
    \item Medium: 13\\
    Most characters have a good chance of succeeding on these checks.
    Trained characters will usually succeed on these checks.
    \item Hard: 18\\
    These tasks are becoming more and more difficult.
    Only well-trained characters and seasoned adventurers have a high likelihood to succeed.
    Others will have to be very lucky.
    \item Very Hard: 23\\
    These tasks are becoming extremely difficult.
    It has become very unlikely that someone untrained would be able to succeed on this task.
    Those trained in the task are also more and more likely to fail.
    \item Near impossible: 28\\
    This task is impossible for anyone who is below average in the given attribute.
    Even for the well-trained, it is more likely than not that they will fail.
\end{itemize}

\section{Passage of Time}\label{sec:passageOfTime}
Actions usually take at least some time.
A GM will adjudicate an action at the moment that it starts, and then time will pass while they are acting.\\
The amount of time passing should be clear to the players, and the GM should always be aware what character is performing which action.\\
The amount of time passing during an action is determined by the action itself, and varies during different frames of gameplay.
For example, overland travel might be tracked in hours or even days, while searching a room might take minutes.
All the while, combat will only take a few minutes, maybe even just seconds.

\subsection{Action Points}\label{subsec:actionPoints}
Action Points are a special unit used within the rest of the document.
Action Points (\textbf{AP}) are used to measure time in action-heavy scenes.
An Action Point equals to around 2 seconds.
