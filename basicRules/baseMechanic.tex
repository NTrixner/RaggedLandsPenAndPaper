\chapter{The base mechanic}
\section{Attribute Checks}
Every check is solved by a roll of a D20 You add a specific modifier to your roll, and maybe get additional bonuses if you’re trained in that specific task. Whenever you roll a check, you compare the outcome of your roll to a Difficulty Value (DV). If your roll beats that DV, you are able to perform that task. If your value is lower than the DV, you can not perform the task. If your roll value and the DV are equal, you roll again.

\subsection{Contests}
Sometimes, two people compete in a task. In order to get the outcome, both people roll a D20 and add their relative modifiers, and optional additional dice. The one with the higher result wins the contest. If both rolls are the same, they are rolled again until they are not the same anymore.

\subsection{Helping Others}
Sometimes, a character may be able to help another character with a difficult task. In such a case, the helping character makes the same check that the character receiving help has to complete. The character receiving help gains a modifier on their roll equals to the difference of the helping character and the DV. If multiple characters help someone, these differences are summed.

\subsection{Retries}
In the RLP, rolls also determine ability, not (just) luck. If your character tries to disarm a trap, jump a certain distance or wants to climb a wall, your roll doesn’t determine how your character performs at that task at this moment, it determines if your character is able to perform that task under the current set of circumstances. This means, that unless the circumstances change, the outcome of the roll is fixed. Retries are not an option. If a character rolls to climb a wall and the roll determines he is not able to climb that wall, the characters have to find another way, maybe by using ropes or finding another spot to climb it.
If the circumstances change, rolls can be retried. This can mean stress, new knowledge, new abilities or a changed environment.
A character not able to jump a chasm may just be able to do it if he’s chased by a Giant Monitor Lizard.
A character who once failed to pick a lock may have learned something new about this type of lock from a book or his mentor, and that might give him the edge to pick it.
A character who wasn’t able to lift up a rock may have trained for some weeks and have gotten stronger.
A character who wasn’t able to climb the wall last night when it rained, may be able to do it in daylight, when the wall is dry.

\section{Rounding}
Since this System is written for experienced Tabletop-RPG players, there are a lot of formulas and straightforward calculations. Even though it’s noted everywhere, as a general rule, every time a division happens and the result would be a fraction when an integer is needed, you should round up.

\section{Action Points}
An Action Point \textbf{AP} is a unit of measurement for time. The length of an Action Point depends on the timeframe at which the current play takes place. For example, during the exploration of a Room or dungeon, an Action Point might be 1 Minute, while it might be an hour when it comes to Overland travel. For Combat, an Action Point is considered to be equal to around 2 or 3 seconds.
In general, a GM would determine how many Action Points an action takes, communicate this with the players, and if they insist on performing said action, adjudicate the action immediately, but let time pass afterwards.
Therefore, Action Points can be compared to a "Downtime" mechanic in modern videogames.

\section{Attributes}
There are seven main attributes in the RLP:


\textbf{Strength (STR)} describes a character’s muscle strength. It’s an important ability for melee combat, and determines carrying capacity and stamina


\textbf{Vitality (VIT)} is a character’s bodily defensive ability. It determines how a character is able to withstand extreme weather conditions, sickness or poison. It’s also important for a character’s overall health.


\textbf{Dexterity (DEX)} describes a character’s hand-eye-coordination. It’s important with fine tasks like crafting or disabling traps, picking pockets and locks or tying knots. It also helps with ranged or melee combat, depending on someone’s weapon.


\textbf{Agility (AGI)} is a character’s ability to act when necessary, and also describes how a character is able to move around. It’s important for climbing, swimming, running, sneaking, gymnastics and tumbling in general.


\textbf{Intellect (INT)} describes a character’s overall rational ability, his memory and his ability to acquire knowledge. It can also be used to describe a character’s overall knowledge about a specific topic or lore. It’s also important for magic users.


\textbf{Perception (PER)} is a character’s ability to realize his surroundings. It’s important for battle, but also necessary to survive while exploring dangerous environments. It’s also important for social encounters,.


\textbf{Empathy (EMP)} describes a character’s ability to understand others. It’s important for most social encounters, and determines how easy it is for a character to haggle prices, to talk himself out of a battle or seduce a barmaid.


Each of these attributes are described as a value of 1-12, with 4-7 being average values. A character with a 2 in Empathy may not even be able to articulate a thought, while a character with an 11 in Empathy is able to persuade even kings.

\section{Defensive Attributes}
These values are derived from the main Attributes and describe defensive values that are used when a character would be target of some effect.


\textbf{Dodge} is a character's ability to dodge an incoming attack. It is equal to 10 + AGI + Modifiers


\textbf{Notice} is a carachter's ability to notice something unseen, like a noise, slight draft, or sneaking enemy. It is equal to 10 + PER + Modifiers


\textbf{Willpower} is a character's ability to withstand emotional manipulation, as well as enchantment. It is equal to 10 + EMP + Modifiers.


\section{Pool Values}
For RLP, two main pool values are important, with a third being tracked, but really being just important for magically trained characters. The base number of these values is determined by a character's race.


\textbf{Health} describes a character’s ability to withstand any type of damage. Health can be seen as a combination of resilience, bodily health and luck. If a character reaches 0 Health, he is \textbf{dead}. A character with less than half their Health is considered \textbf{wounded}. Health can be restored by resting (See Recovering Pool values, below), by alchemy and by magic. A character that is dead can not be healed. Reviving magic doesn’t exist in the Ragged Lands.


\textbf{Stamina} describes a character’s ability to act out tasks that are bodily challenging. When a character climbs or swims fast, or if a character uses special maneuvers in combat, he loses stamina. Stamina can be restored by resting (See below). It usually doesn’t take much longer than an hour to completely restore Stamina, so outside of a stressful situation, a character usually has full Stamina. A character with less than half of their Stamina becomes \textbf{exhausted}. If a character reaches a Stamina of 0, they become \textbf{unconscious}.


\textbf{Mana} is usually tracked for every character, but only important for magic users. It describes a character’s ability to cast spells. Casting a spell costs Mana, and a character replenishes mana by eating. A character with less than half their Mana is considered \textbf{drained}. A character that reaches 0 Mana becomes \textbf{paralyzed}.


\subsection{Recovering Pool Values}

For each of the 3 different Pool values, recovery works the same way, but is triggered by different conditions. Whenever one of these conditions occur, the characters regain points in that pool value as mentioned below


\subsection{Health}

Aside from using special tools or magic for healing, each character has the ability to recover health in a natural way. A character's natural healing ability allows them to heal 1 points of health, per 1 hour. While resting, this healing effect is doubled.
A priest or healer may further improve someone's natural healing ability.


\subsection{Stamina}

Stamina can be recovered by taking a break, regaining breath, not moving too much around, sitting down for a minute or two or drinking a bit of water. For every 3 seconds a character rests like that (or every AP in combat they spend just resting), they gain back 1 Stamina.


\subsection{Mana}

Mana is recovered over time, but the rate at which it recovers can be influenced by the food that the caracter eats. A meal usually lasts for 8 hours. A usual ration provides a recovery of 1d6 points per hour.
