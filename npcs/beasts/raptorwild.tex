\section{Wild Raptor}

These wild, bipedal reptiles live in packs of two to five, but can also be found solitary. They usually nest whenever they find a partner, forming a livelong bond. They are ground breeders, with one partner guarding the nest around the clock while the other is hunting. Raptors are opportunistic hunters, usually hunting smaller animals or other raptors, but they also scavenge cadavers of prey killed by larger animals, nests and leftover food from humans. This may result in them becoming a threat, in which case they have to be hunted and killed. Wild raptors cannot be tamed, but they can be raised from their eggs.
