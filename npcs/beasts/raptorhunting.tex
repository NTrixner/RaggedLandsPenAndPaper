\section{Hunting Raptor}

A freshly hatched raptor usually imprints on the first creature it sees. It can then be raised to hunt alongside that person. Hunting raptors are usually raised to be stronger than their wild counterparts, being able to hunt larger animals and killing other prey. They are a rare commodity and highly sought after pets, loyal until to the death and extremely possessive of their owner.
