\section{Spitfly}

Spitflies are flying insectoids the size of a small dog or a cat. They live in hives, defending their larvae and queen in swarms of 5 to 20. The queen itself looks like a bloated version of the wasplike worker-warriors, and is defenseless. The worker-warriors have a stinger that secretes a dangerous poison. Using it kills the spitfly however, so they usually resort to spitting a corrosive, bile-like liquid at their enemies.
