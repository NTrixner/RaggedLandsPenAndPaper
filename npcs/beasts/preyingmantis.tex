\section{Preying Mantis}

This large, burrowing, carnivorous insectoid is the bane of most farmers. They usually don't attack humans unless provoked, but have been known to kill children. Usually, they instead prefer to hunt livestock and smaller animals, like dogs, pigs and pultry. They live in selfmade burrows, where their queen lays eggs around the clock. Their hunters use swordlike front appendages to kill and cut meat, using it to feed their queen and young.
