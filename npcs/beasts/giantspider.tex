\section{Giant Spider}

Giant Spiders live solitarily or in groups of up to 100, usually with only a handful of grown adult females guarding over a large amount of young. They spin sticky webs which are difficult to destroy, and hunt by catching prey in it. Giant Spiders can become the height of a war horse. They are usually dormant in cooler climates, only moving to hunt and defend their lair. In warmer regions, they are far more aggressive, oftentimes hunting without a net. Their large mandibles produce a strong poison, that is able to kill large creatures like humans, dogs and even cattle.
