\section{Blackhound}

Blackhounds are large, wild dogs that roam the countryside and prefer to hunt livestock and humans alike. They are the size of small ponies, and very muscular in build. Blackhounds usually roam solitarily, mating only rarely. This has made them a rarity, and people usually associate bad luck with seeing a Blackhound. Their likeness to domesticated dogs makes them even more dangerous, since children oftentimes approach them like they would a pet. This usually proves fatal, since human children are somewhat of a delicacy to blackhounds.
