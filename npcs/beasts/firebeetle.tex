\section{Fire Beetle}

Fire beetles are large insectoids. They can fly, but exhaust fast due to their large size, and therefore prefer to crawl along the floor, ceilings and walls. They usually live solitarily unless mating, and are very territorial. Fire beetles get their name from large mandibles that they rub against each other with high speed, creating large temperatures when threatened. They can then spit water through the mandibles, creating dangerous steam. They also use the mandibles as melee weapons directly.
