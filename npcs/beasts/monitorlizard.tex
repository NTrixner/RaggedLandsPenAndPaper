\section{Monitor Lizard}

These four-legged animals are the size of a larger pony or a small horse, but only stand hip-height. Their spit is pseudo-venomous, with a toxin-like effect caused by highly aggressive bacteria that they use to digest food rapidly. They breed by laying their eggs into sand pits that they dig themselves. Some cultures have learned to tame monitor lizards, teaching them to guard areas and hunt prey. This is very dangerous however, since the reptiles are relatively stupid and have low vision. They often mistake their owners for prey, food or a threat, lashing out at them.
