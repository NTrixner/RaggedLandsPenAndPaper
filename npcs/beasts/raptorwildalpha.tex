\section{Wild Raptor Alpha}

Sometimes, raptors find themselves in larger packs. This usually happens when resources are bountiful and threats are low. In such a pack, one male usually emerges as an alpha through violent, but typically non-lethal battles. It then has the right to breed with all other females and can direct the members of the pack to do its bidding. It does so through simple, guttural sounds that are similar to a bird's chirping or a fox call. A wild raptor alpha can learn up to 20 distinctive sounds, each of which has a specific meaning to the members of the pack.
