\section{Riding Raptor}

A freshly hatched raptor usually imprints on the first creature it sees. It can then be raised to carry that person. A raptor usually matures in 5 years, and is very fast compared to a horse. Riding raptors are usually not able to fight, but keep their calm during a combat situation. They are however very frail.
