\section{Dire Wolf}

This special breed of wolf is smaller, but much more aggressive than normal wolves. They also hunt in packs, albeit smaller ones than typical wolves. Their bite is stronger than that of a normal wolf, and they are much more resilient. Unlike normal wolves, dire wolves also freely attack people and livestock.
