\section{Bear}

These large animals roam alone or in groups of two to four around the countryside. They're usually somewhat docile and prefer to stay away from civilization, but a mother with her cubs might resort to violence against humans and their livestock in order to feed her young. Bears are formidable foes when challenged and hunting them is extremely dangerous.
