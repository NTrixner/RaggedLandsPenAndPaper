\section{Boar}

Boars, also known as wild pigs, roam the countryside in large families and prefer to eat mushrooms, nuts and young saplings. A pack of grazing boars can kill off large swaths of forest in a short time. This - combined with the facts that they are very territorial and their meat is tender and tasty - makes them targets of hunters wherever they can be found. However, a trampling hoarde of boars should never be underestimated, as should their tusks be feared by anyone unprepared.
