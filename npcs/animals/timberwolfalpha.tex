\section{Timber Wolf Alpha}

Unlike other wolves, timber wolf alphas are not the strongest or most dominant males in the pack, but the smartest ones. They employ tactics instead of brute force to lead their packs, and the success of the hunt determines and secures their status. A timber wolf alpha that lead some unsuccessful hunts might be challenged by a younger male to a fight, risking its status and live.
