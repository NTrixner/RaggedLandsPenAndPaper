These brass constructs were designed by the Nay and Shadim people to serve in their armies. They can oftentimes be found on old battlefields, or deactivated in larger quantities wherever there are storage facilities in abandoned cities. They move on four legs, and are equipped with an arm that is shaped like an arming sword and another one shaped like a morningstar flail. They can also use lightning as a weapon, emitting lightning bolts from their sword arm.
