\section{Clockwork Augur}

These small, hovering brass spheres are monitor old, abandoned Nay and Shadim Cities. They are equipped with a large, camera-like device that makes up most of their body. When finding intruders, they emit a high-pitched alarm sound, alerting active and inactive clockwork constructs in the area. If threatened, they can defend themselves with lightning bolts, but usually stay out of melee range.\\
