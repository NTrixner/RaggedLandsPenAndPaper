\section{Clockwork Guard}

These brass constructs were designed by the Nay and Shadim people to defend their now abandoned cities from intruders. They usually patrol these ruins on their four legs, and are equipped with a shortsword-like piercer and a shield. They can use sound to incapacitate living creatures, emitting it in a cone-like shape before them.
