\section{Clockwork Automaton}

These brass constructs are created as workers in now abandoned Nay and Shadim cities. They infest those ruins and are oftentimes inactive until a living creature comes near them. They then attack with what once was used as pickaxes, screwdrivers or other tools.
Automatons are small, bipedal and relatively fragile, but when facing danger oftentimes emit an alarming buzz that draws other automatons and clockwork warriors near.\\
