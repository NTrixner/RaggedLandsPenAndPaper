Halkarans mature at the age of 14, and live to be around 60.\\

At their worst, halkarans are naive, intrusive and dishonest.\\
Every Halkaran starts with an \textbf{Agility increased by 1}.\\
Also, Halkarans' \textbf{Dexterity increases by 2}\\
However, every Halkaran's \textbf{Strength is reduced by 2}.\\
Halkarans are known to have a built-in ability when it comes to throwing things accurately.
Many people have suffered head fractures from Halkaran-thrown stones over the ages.
This means that \textbf{Halkarans add 1d4 to attack rolls made with throwing weapons.}\\
Additionally, Halkaran's Luck is a winged word. \textbf{A Halkaran can reroll one Natural 1 per day}.\\
Their small size allows them to sneak better.
They \textbf{are always treated to have a stealth perk 1 level higher than they trained it}\\
