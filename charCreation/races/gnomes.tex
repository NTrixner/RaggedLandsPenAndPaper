At their best, gnomes are friendly, calm and wise.\\
At their worst, gnomes are stubborn, close-minded and vengeful.\\
Every Gnome starts with an \textbf{Empathy increased by 2}.\\
Also, Gnome' \textbf{Agility increases by 1}\\
However, every Gnome's \textbf{Strength is reduced by 2}.\\
Gnomes have a supernatural gift that allows them to \textbf{understand and talk to animals as if they were speaking their language.}\\
