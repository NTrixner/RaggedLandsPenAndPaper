At their worst, gnomes are stubborn, close-minded and vengeful.\\
Every Gnome starts with a \textbf{Racial Empathy Bonus of +2}.\\
Also, Gnomes have a \textbf{Racial Agility Bonus of +1}\\
However, every Gnome has a \textbf{Racial Strength Malus of -2}.\\
Gnomes have a supernatural gift that allows them to \textbf{understand and talk to animals as if they were speaking their language.}\\
In most situations however, animals have a very short memory and aren't too intelligent.\\
