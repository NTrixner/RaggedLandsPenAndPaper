\chapter{Cultures}\label{ch:cultures}
Every player character was raised in a certain environment which might not be directly linked to their race.
Choose one of these cultural backgrounds when creating a new character.
You gain a +1d6 skill bonus to social interactions with members of said culture.
Additionally, you also gain this bonus when recalling information about the culture, it's governments, history, legends, arts, crafts, the areas it is typically found in, and other checks related to that culture.
