\chapter{Backgrounds}
Every character falls under one of these backgrounds.
It represents their upbringing, standing in society, as well their story up until they started to work as an adventurer. \\
While creating a character, you may combine elements of backgrounds, or talk with your GM and create a background yourself.\\
