\section{The Worker}

Those born under the sign of The Worker are reliable, diligent and honorable, but also tend to be thick-headed.\\
As someone born under the sign of The Worker, you can gain 5 temporary Stamina + 2 temporary stamina for each level of "Increase Stamina" that you have once per day. These temporary stamina are used up after the rest of your stamina, and you lose the leftover temporary stamina after 10 minutes. You can do so as part of any other action you're performing.\\
