\section{The Fateless}

Those born under the sign of the Fateless don't really share any traits in common, but their birth is said to be an ill omen for the days to come.\\
As someone born under the sign of The Fateless, you may repeat a roll you made once per day. If this roll is a check (i.e. a D20 roll) and the second result is lower, you take 1 untyped damage per Point of difference between the two rolls (i.e. when your first roll was 7 and your second was 3, you'd take 4 untyped damage), and the task automatically fails as if your total result was a 0.\\
