\section{Ranger}\label{background:ranger}
You've grown up in the wilderness, and lived your live up until now as a ranger.
Maybe you lived in a small village and spent your days in the forest, or maybe you lived as a hermit in a mountain cave, surviving off of mushrooms and small animals.
Nature is your backyard, and you know the plants and creatures of your homeland like the back of your hands.

\subsection{Statistics}
Choose up to three biomes from the list of biomes in Appendix C.
You gain a +1d4 experience bonus on checks regarding survival, lore (fauna) and lore (flora) while you are in one of these biomes.

\subsection{Adventuring Hook and Goal}
Maybe the balance of nature in your homelands has been disturbed, and you are searching for the reason why this is happening.
Or you have lived out your vow of solitude, and are now returning to civilized lands.
Perhaps, a person that came across you in a time of need, or in their last moments, asked you for a favor.
Maybe you were part of a circle of druids that was destroyed, and you travel to avenge them, or you were sent to find and eliminate a traitor.
