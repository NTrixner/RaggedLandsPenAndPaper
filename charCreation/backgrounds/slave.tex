\section{Slave}\label{background:slave}
You were a slave before. 
Maybe you were born as a slave, or maybe you became a slave through conquest or financial burden.
In any case, you are not free, and are required manual labor.

\subsection{Statistics}
You start the game with 1 Perk Rank in~\ref{perk:increasestamina},~\ref{sec:survival}, and~\ref{sec:stealth}.
These do count towards your Perk costs, but not towards your first rank increase when creating a new character.

\subsection{Adventuring Hook}
Maybe you are currently on the run and are hiding from your owner.
You might have changed your identity to escape your enslavement.
Optionally, your owner might be the one that sent you out to find something -  or someone - or perform a different task, that he trusts you with.
Or, maybe your owner is one of the other players, watching every one of your steps.

\subsection{Goals}
Your goal might be to escape your owners, and the agents that they send to recapture you.
Or you might work towards paying off the debt that sent you into slavery to begin with.
Maybe you're also working towards freeing other slaves, either the ones that your owners still control, or you work towards freeing slaves wherever you go.
In any case, freedom is likely one of your goals.
