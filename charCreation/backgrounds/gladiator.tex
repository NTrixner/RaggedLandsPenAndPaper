\section{Gladiator}\label{background:gladiator}
You are -- or were -- a Gladiator.
As a showman of martial arts, you fought in one or many of the multitude of arenas around the world, showing off your martial prowess, as well as impressing the crowds with your charisma.
It is a dangerous job, and you might be wearing not just one scar from your past.

\subsection{Statistics}
You start the game with 1 Perk Rank in~\ref{perk:simpleWeaponTraining},~\ref{perk:lightArmorTraining} and~\ref{sec:performance}(Oratory).
These do count towards your Perk costs, but not towards your first rank increase when creating a new character.

\subsection{Adventuring Hook}
Maybe you come from a land, where many of the Gladiators are slaves, and you have just won enough money to free yourself, now roaming the lands in search for new glory, and income.
Alternatively, you joined the trade voluntarily, having a knack for show-fights and entertaining the crowd - and now, you are touring the lands, travelling from one arena to the next and challenging their champions.
You could also be a member of a troupe, hired as a strongman or bodyguard, and participating in gladiatorial combat whenever possible.

\subsection{Goals}
Most likely, your place is in the arena because of Gold, Guts and Glory.
Or maybe you have someone at home that you send your money to - a sickly parent, a worried spouse and children.
Maybe being a Gladiator is just a guise, and an easy way to travel far and earn enough money to keep yourself afloat, while you search for a certain someone or something.
