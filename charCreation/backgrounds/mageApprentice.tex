\section{Mage's Apprentice}\label{background:mageApprentice}
You were taken in as the apprentice of a mage.
This means that you lived in his tower, and worked as both student and servant there.
You learned magical abilities while training with your teacher, and have enjoyed some level of education from them.

\subsection{Statistics}
You gain a +1d4 experience bonus on checks regarding lore (magic), and another lore perk of your choice.

\subsection{Adventuring Hook and Goals}
Maybe your old Master has died, entrusting you with finding the solution to an old question that has plagued their later research.
Maybe your master is still alive and well, and sent you out after teaching you what they knew, urging you to join an Arcane Academy, or to meet a new master that could teach you further.
Or your master was abusive, and you fled (possibly after defending yourself violently) and are now on the run from them.
Maybe your master was benevolent, but killed by shadowy figures in a stormy night after urging you to flee, and now you both fear these attackers, while also plotting your revenge against them.
Your Goals might include finding new magical knowledge, or finding fame and fortune to help your old teacher or repair his broken reputation.
Contrarily, you might try to kill your old master for all of the abuse and neglect you suffered from them.
