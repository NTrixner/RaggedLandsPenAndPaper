\section{Urchin}\label{background:urchin}
You grew up on the streets of a town or city, living in squalor and peddling or stealing for survival.
Maybe you were part of a gang of street urchins, or maybe you grew up in an orphanage, under oppressive patrons that mistreated you.
It is however also possible, that you had a home and parents growing up, but your parents were poor or addicted and didn't take care of you, and so you took to the streets.

\subsection{Adventuring Hook and Goal}
For urchins, becoming adventurers is a common career path - it is dangerous, but anyone can become an adventurer, and a few even survive and make money doing it.
Maybe someone took you under patronage, and now you want to repay them for their kindness.
On the other hand, it might be that you joined a thieves' guild, and working as an adventurer is a great way to hide your true intentions.
It could also have happened that you joined a secret society whose members found you and thought of your abilities as useful for their goals.
You might try to help them with their goals, or you could have defected after being taught by them, now making your own way in life.
In any case, your goals might include the people you grew up with, or people that you owe something to.
Or you might just be drawn by the promise of gold, escaping your old life and building a normal, maybe even a noble, life.
