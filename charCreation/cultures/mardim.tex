\section{Mardim Islands}\label{culture:mardim}
You were raised in Mardim Culture, which originates in Mar Calda, Mar Cota and the island of Kaldar.
Mardim society is organized in small city states, lead by either kings or local groups of wealthy families.
The surrounding farmsteads tend to grow olives, simple grains, and root vegetables, and raise cattle and pigs.
In Mardim society, simple life, as well as physical and mental fortitude are valued highly.
Mardim are artisans, farmers, clerics, mages, monks, sailors, mercenaries, travelling merchants, slaves and gladiators.
Mardim dwellings are usually made from stone or clay, with wooden buildings being relatively rare.
Depending on the particular inclination of a city, a mardim might value philosophy, wisdom and magic, or physical prowess and strategic might.
Many Mardim live off of fish, and their central position in the sea of storms allows them to trade with many other peoples.
As a result, Mardim ships are oftentimes targeted by Corsaren raiders.
Additionally, the different city states are oftentimes at war with each other.
