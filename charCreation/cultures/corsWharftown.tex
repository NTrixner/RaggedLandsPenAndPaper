\section{Corsar Wharftown}\label{culture:corsWharftown}
You were raised in the mechanical wonder that is the city of Wharftown, an old Shadim Fortress converted into the current capital of the Corsaren Empire.
People living in this multi-tiered construction are of all walks of life, but many of them are urchins, artisans (especially magitek artisans), sailors, slaves and nobles.
Wharftown itself is a circular city in 7 layers above each other, rising like a monolith into the red grasslands of the central Corsaren Basin.
The core and frame of the town is made of unknown Shadim metals, but it is filled with small dwellings made of sheet metals, wood, clay and dirt.
Slits were made into the side of the town to accomodate the dry docks of the royal airship fleet of the emperor, as well as the 5 flagships of the Corsaren Admirals.
The Admirals with their families, the Emperor and the imperial court, and other nobles and high-ranking bureaucrats, live on the top layer of the town, above the clouds.
The further down, and especially the further inward, the poorer the people living in this town become.
In the lower levels and inner quarters, even clean water becomes a luxury, usually evaporated from waste water by the use of magical torches.
Corsaren Wharftown culture is a culture of extremes, and as a result strong liquor and drugs, as well as exquisite wines and jewellery are products often seen here.
