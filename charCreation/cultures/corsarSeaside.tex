\section{Corsaren Port-dwellings and Seafarers}\label{culture:corsarSeaside}
You were raised in Corsaren culture, but not in the capital city of Wharftown.
The coastal towns of Cors and their other dwellings, many small towns on distant shores, are usually built of local materials.
This includes clay, stone and local woods.
Corsars enjoy trade, fishing, exploring, and fishing.
Many of them are sailors, mercanaries, travelling merchants, and artisans.
Corsaren culture is based on music, alcohol, song, brawls, as well as the ocean.
Corsars therefore whorship Irani, with a special focus on her children Taifun and Oceanus.
This is more of a fearful respect than true faith, however.
The ocean is a dangerous place, and Corsars know this.
For the most part, Corsars are organized in small, power-based governments, with many of the local leaders calling themselves "Admirals".
This is a mere insult to mainland Corsars, however, which are organized in 5 Armadas.
These Armadas are lead by Admirals, ruling the continent as representatives of the Emperor of Cors.
As Corsaren Culture is centered around freedom and power, a lot of fighting tends to happen between the Armadas, and inside of them as well.
