\section{Bowmaking Blueprints}\label{sec:bowmakingBlueprints}
Bowmaking blueprints are organised by Tiers.
Crafting a bowmaking item requires 1 hour for every 10 gold in the resulting item's value and a Dexterity check.
It also requires a knife.
Beating the blueprint's DV by 5 or more yields the 1st bonus, beating it by 10 or more rewards the creator with the second bonus instead.\\
For weapons and ammo, beating the DV by 5 or more yields an item +1, beating it by 10 yields an item +2, and beating it by 15 yields an item +3.\\
