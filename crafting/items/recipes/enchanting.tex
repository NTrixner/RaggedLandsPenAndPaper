\section{Enchantments}\label{sec:enchantments}
Enchantments can be placed on different types of equipment, like armor, rings or necklaces.
Enchanting an item changes its value by the given amount, and requires the listed ingredients.
Enchanting something usually takes 1 hour of time for every 100 gold that the resulting item is worth.
If the Creation DV is failed by 5 or more, the ingredients - but not the enchanting target - are lost.\\
