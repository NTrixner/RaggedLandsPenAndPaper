\section{Alchemical Recipes}

Alchemical recipes are organised by levels. Each potion requires mortar and pestle, and it takes 1 hour to create up to 5 potions. Each potion requires one set of ingredients and a solvent. Also, it is neccessary to use a vial to create a potion. If the solvent is already in a vial, no additional vial is neccessary.
Each 1-hour batch is created by rolling the check only once. 
The first bonus is applied when the Difficulty Value of that recipe is beaten by 5, and the second bonus is applied when the Difficulty Value is beaten by 10. 
If the check is failed by 5 or more, the creation fails and all the ingredients are lost. Otherwise, the creation fails and 1 hour passes, but the creator keeps the ingredients. Creating a potion requires some way of heating it.\\
