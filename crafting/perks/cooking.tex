You can combine items into food. To do so, you have to learn recipes (See Equipment). You can learn recipes of level 1. Most recipes require some type of cooking equipment, and can be improved by higher quality items or additional tools as noted on the recipe. Cooking usually involves an Intellect check. You can add your Adventure level to this check. \\
