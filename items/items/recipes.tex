\section{Cooking Recipes}

Alchemical recipes are organised by levels. Each recipe requires cooking utensils, and it takes 1 hour to create up to 3 recipes. Each recipe requires one set of ingredients and yields the listed amount of meals.
Each batch is created by rolling the check only once.
If the DV for the creation is beaten by 5 or more, one additional meal is created. If it is beaten by 10 or more, two additional meals are created instead.
If the check is failed by 5 or more, the creation fails and all the ingredients are lost. Otherwise, the creation fails and 1 hour passes, but the creator keeps the ingredients.\\
