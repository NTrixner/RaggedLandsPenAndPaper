\subsection{Flammable}\label{armor:flammable}
An Armor with this attribute easily catches fire.
Whenever a character wearing it would take heat damage, the armor starts to burn.\\
Burning Armor can be put out by anyone who is able to touch it.
Doing so takes 4 AP.\\
Burning Armor is also extinguished when the wearer would take cold damage, or when it is doused in water.\\
If burning armor isn't put out by some other effect, it burns for 6 AP if it's cloth or light armor, 10 AP if it is medium or 14 AP if it is heavy.\\
While wearing a burning armor, the wearer takes 1 heat damage per AP that passes until it is put out.
Any armor that burned for at least 1 AP becomes damaged afterwards, losing all of its properties.

\subsection{Horrid}\label{armor:horrid}
An Armor with the horrid attribute has dark energies associated with it.
When the wearer of such armor takes necrose or psychic damage, they take an additional 3 damage from that damage source.

\subsection{Enchantable}\label{armor:enchantable}
An Armor that has this attribute can be enchanted a different amount than just once.
It can instead hold an amount of Enchantments by the number specified.

\subsection{Lightweight}\label{armor:lightweight}
An Armor with the Leightweight attribute reduces the wearer's Agility as if it were one Weight class lower.

An armor with the "under" attribute can be worn under any "over" armor.\\
An armor with the "over" attribute can be worn over any "under" armor.\\
When both armors grant resistances to a damage type, do not add them together.
Instead, the larger respective resistance count.\\
Wearing two pieces of armor reduces a character's Agility by 2, to a minimum of 1.

\subsection{Pockets}\label{armor:pockets}
An armor with Pockets has the ability to hold a certain amount of items in its pockets.
For example, a piece of Armor might have "Pockets (4S)", which means that it can hold 4 small items.
These 4 small items are assumed to be divided into different pockets, like two regular trouser pockets, one breast pocket and one back pocket.
