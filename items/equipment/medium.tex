\subsection{Medium Armor}\label{subsec:mediumArmor}
Medium Armor is a great balance between the strong defenses of heavy armor and the agility of light armor.
It is often made of cloth with strips of metal sewn in, or with leather pads.
It can also consist of overlapping slabs of metal or leather, giving the armor scales.
It takes 5 Minutes to don or remove medium armor.
While wearing medium armor, a character's Agility can not exceed 8.
