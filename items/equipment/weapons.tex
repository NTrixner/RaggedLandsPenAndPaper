\chapter{Weapons}\label{ch:weapons}
These are weapons that can be bought, their descriptors, their reach, the abilities that can be used for their attack and block rolls, their attack and block actions themselves and their weight and price.\\
\section{Description}\label{sec:weaponDescription}
\subsection{Weapon quality}\label{subsec:weaponQuality}
Manufactured weapons can have different qualities.
For example, a dagger might be rusted or a longsword might be masterfully crafted.
The quality of a weapon changes its damage - this modifier ranges from --3 (broken) to +3 (high mastery craftsmanship).
The quality of a weapon changes its base price:\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item -3: Base Price * 1/4
    \item -2: Base Price * 1/2
    \item -1: Base Price * 3/4
    \item 0: Base Price
    \item +1: Base Price * 1.5
    \item +2: Base Price * 2
    \item +3: Base Price * 3
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multiple Damage Types}\label{subsec:multipleDamageTypeWeapons}
Some weapons, like the~\nameref{weapon:mace} have attacks that deal multiple damage types.
Whenever a wielder of such a weapon gains a bonus to weapon damage (from high quality, a race like~\nameref{race:daevana} or a perk like~\nameref{maneuver:brutalAttack}), they can choose which damage type to apply each modifier to.

\subsection{Draw/Sheath Weapons}\label{subsec:sheathWeapons}
Most weapons have a sheath/unsheath action.
This action denotes how many AP it cost to draw and sheath a weapon.
Sheathing or drawing a weapon can be done as part of another action, such as an attack.\\
A weapon that does not have a draw/sheath action is considered to be non-sheathable, meaning it has to be carried around in some other way.

\subsection{Scabbards and straps}\label{subsec:scabbards}
In order to carry a weapon sheathed, a character must affix a scabbard or holding strap to their back or belt.
When buying a weapon, this container is considered to be part of the base price.\\
If a weapon can not be sheathed, it is assumed that it does not have a scabbard or holding strap.
