\section{Calmed}
A calmed character can dodge attacks even if they exceed his Reaction Value, and dodging doesn't cost stamina for a calmed character.

\section{Enraged}
An \textbf{enraged} character adds their Strength to any Strength-based attack damage. They lose their ability to do anything else than moving and attacking with melee, Strength-based weapon attacks. This means they also cannot dodge, block, or use attack-augmenting perks like Aimed Attack or Brutal Attack. They drop any wielded weapons that don't allow for such an attack and use their fists instead. They then move to the closest creature no matter if friend or foe and start trying to kill it (choosing at random if multiple creatures are the same distance away). While enraged, a character loses 1 point of stamina per AP, until they fall unconscious. If an enraged character reaches 0 Health, they don't die immediately. Instead, any damage beyond 0 Health reduces their stamina. If they aren't healed until their rage ends, they die once it does.

\section{Invisible}
An invisible character can not be seen. When an invisible character tries to move stealthily, they can roll twice, taking the higher result. Any attack rolls against invisible characters are reduced by 10.

\section{Poisoned}

\section{Prone}
A prone character is crawling or lying on the ground. Melee attack rolls against prone characters are increased by 5, ranged attack rolls against prone characters are reduced by 5. While being prone, moving costs twice the AP for a character.
Standing up is a form of movement, and takes 2 AP if the character is unarmored or in light armor, 4 AP if the character is in medium armor and 6 AP if they are in heavy armor.
