You spend 12 AP to summon a creature from its soul shard. The spell costs 2 times the creature’s total level in Mana.\\

The summon takes the form it had in life, but it gains the Etherealness Descriptor. It is at full health every time it is summoned. If the creature had equipment while dying, it is adorned with ethereal copies of the equipment it had on its body directly before death (e.g. if the creature was disarmed and then killed before it could pick this weapon up again, the ethereal creature doesn’t have that weapon). You can only keep one summon at a time, and it stays for up to 10 minutes, or until it is slain. If it is slain, the soul shard shatters and ceases to function.\\
