\section{Sneak Attack}
\textbf{Cost:} 100 CP\\
\textbf{Requirements:} -\\
\textbf{Maneuver, Active, Repeatable, Source(50 Gold)}\\
You can spend 4 Stamina while making a melee weapon attack based on DE or AG, targeting a creatureâ€™s weak spot. Enemies immune to critical hits are immune to this effect. You can only do a sneak attack if the target hasn't seen you or is unable to react to your attack. You deal damage as if you had already hit and as if the target was not wearing any armor, so the target's armor reduction is bypassed and you deal 1d6 additional damage.\\
