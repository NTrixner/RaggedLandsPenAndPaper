\section{Mirage}
\textbf{Cost:} 100 CP\\
\textbf{Requirements:}  Arcane Training I\\
\textbf{Spell, Active, Source(50 Gold), Memory}\\
For 4 AP and 5 Mana, you create a mirage not larger than 1 passus wide, 1 passus deep and 2 passus high. Keeping the mirage up costs 1 mana per hour, but doesn't require concentration. Changing the mirage costs 2 Mana, and requires you to see the mirage. You can dismiss the mirage at any time, but it cannot be kept up any longer than your Intellect value in hours.\\
\\
The DV of spotting the illusion is determined by your Intellect check. Roll once when creating the Mirage, and again whenever you change it. \\
\\
Any creature seeing the mirage makes a Perception (Deception) check. If they succeed, they realize the true nature of the Illusion. If they fail, they are fooled by the mirage. Any creature interacting with the mirage instantly realize that the Mirage is fake.\\
