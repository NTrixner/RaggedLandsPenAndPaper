\section{Blue Odem Flame}
\textbf{Cost:} 500 CP\\
\textbf{Requirements:} Odem I\\
\textbf{Active, Repeatable}\\
While being calm, you can call forth the power of oppression inside of you, producing a blue, flame-like substance from your hands.\\
Any melee weapon attacks you do while this flame is active deal an additional 1d6 electricity damage and daze the target for the same amount of AP as the lightning damage dealt.\\
However, whenever making a melee weapon attack, you also must make an Empathy check against a Difficulty Value of 15. If you succeed, the Difficulty value increases by 2 for the next check. If you fail, you lose 1d6+5 Balance Points. You stop producing the flame when you stop being calmed.\\
