\section{The Hero}

Those born under the sign of The Hero are helpful, selfless and assertive, but also tend to be brash and overly emotional.\\
As someone born under the sign of The Hero, once per day when a creature in an area of 5 passus around you would take damage from a single source, you can decide to reduce that damage by half, taking the other half. This includes all types of damage taken, and you must make this choice before the amount of damage is determined.\\
