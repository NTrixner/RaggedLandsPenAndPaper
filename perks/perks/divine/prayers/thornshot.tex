\section{Thorn Shot}
\textbf{Cost:} 100 CP\\
\textbf{Requirements:} Disciple of a Irani, 3 Piety Points \\
\textbf{Active, Prayer, Weapon, Repeatable, Source(50 Gold)}\\
Pray for 4 AP. Make a ranged weapon attack against a creature of your choice. A thorn grows on the palm of your hand and shoots forward, hitting the creature. The thorn deals 1D8 piercing damage. If the creature is a humanoid, add your Empathy to that damage. If the creature is a construct, the thorn deals 1D10 + your Empathy instead. If the creature is dealt any damage, make an Empathy check, contested by the creature's Strength check. If you succeed, the creature becomes bound by a growth of vines growing from the point of impact. While being bound, a creature can not move. It takes 1 AP for every point of damage the thorn dealt to remove the vines, but other creatures can help unbinding someone.\\
