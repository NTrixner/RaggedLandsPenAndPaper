Pray for 6 AP. Choose a creature that you can see. Roll 1D6 + your Empathy. You can reduce your own health by this amount, healing the target creature by the same amount. Or you can reduce the creature's health and heal that amount of health yourself instead. If the target creature isn't willing, they can make a Vitality check against your Empathy check to resist this effect. If they resist, you can transfer only half the amount of health.\\
