\section{Odem Sigil}
\textbf{Cost:} 0\\
\textbf{Requirements:} Odem\\
\textbf{Passive, Unlearnable}\\
A sigil was placed somewhere on your body. It represses the powers of your Odem, but also makes it possible to control it.\\
All perks that require the Odem perk cost double the Gold to learn for you.\\
When you become enraged, you roll a 1d10 instead of a 1d6 to determine if you have a burstout, and you only burstout if that roll is a 1.\\
The sigil can hold back 10 burstouts. After the 10th burstout it disappears completely, the Seeker Guild becomes aware of this fact, and you lose this perk. The Seeker Guild can replenish the sigil, and it does so for free - they may even force the sigil onto you.\\
While a sigil is placed on you, your Odem Perk is considered to be level 1 regardless of what level you actually trained it to.\\
