You can supervise the healing process of a resting creature by sitting by their side, chanting this prayer in a rosary-like way. While this happens they restore 2 points of health per hour instead of 1.\\
For every 10 Piety Points that you have above 9, this can affect an additional creature. This means that you can affect 2 creatures if you have 10-19 Piety Points, 3 if you have 20-29 Piety Points, etc.\\
