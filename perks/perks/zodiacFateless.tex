\section{The Fateless}

Those born under the sign of the Fateless don't really share any traits in common, but their birth is said to be an ill omen for the days to come.\\
As someone born under the sign of The Fateless, you may repeat one roll you made once per day. If this roll is a check (i.e. a D12 roll) and the second result is a 1, you take 1D4 untyped damage per Point of difference between the two rolls (i.e. when your first roll was 12 and your second was 8, you'd take 4d4 untyped damage), and the task automatically fails as if your total result was a 1.\\
