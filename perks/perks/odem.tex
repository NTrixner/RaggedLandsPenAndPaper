\textbf{Cost:} 0\\
\textbf{Requirements:} Balance\\
\textbf{Passive, Repeatable}\\
You were born with the power of Odem inside of you. This allows you to train in the three flames of power, but also to gain other abilities as well. However, Odem is not a gift, but a curse instead. Whenever you would become enraged, your willpower may instead explode in an invisible, violent force. Roll a D6. On an odd number, every creature in a 20 passus radius around you must make a Vitality Check. The DV of this check is your Empathy + 7 + your combined level, and they can add their combined level to the check if they also have the Odem perk. If they fail, they take 1d10 pyschic damage per level you have (all three levels). You then fall unconscious and gain 50 balance points.\\
After your first burstout like this, a guild of specialized manhunters called "The Seekers", which is part of the Church of Four, becomes aware of you, and starts hunting for you. Once they catch you and take you into custody, they seal your powers with an Odem Sigil.
