\textbf{Requirements:} Disciple of a God, 10 Piety Points \\
\textbf{Active, Prayer, Repeatable, Memory}\\
You pray for 8 AP, and every creature allied to you in a range of 10 passus of you gains one of the following benefits of your choice:
\begin{itemize}
	\item +1d4 on every attack and defense roll for the next 15 minutes
	\item Immunity to the frightened condition for the next hour
	\item +1d4 on their next stat roll, or until one hour has passed
	\item +1 armor defense against one damage type of your choice for the next hour
	\item Any creature can only benefit from one of these buffs at any time
\end{itemize}

Level Progression:\\
You can apply the armor defense effect for multiple damage types at higher levels. These effects don't stack, so a creature can't benefit from +2d4 on their next stat roll.\\
