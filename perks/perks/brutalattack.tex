\textbf{Maneuver, Active, Repeatable, Source}\\
When making a melee weapon attack based on Strength, you can pay 5 Stamina to add one Weapon Damage Die. For example, if your weapon would deal 1D12 damage, you deal 2D12 damage instead. Note: There are weapons that already have multiple Weapon Dice. For example, a weapon dealing 2D6 damage would deal 3D6 instead, NOT 4D6.\\
