\section{Brutal Attack}
\textbf{Cost:} 100 CP\\
\textbf{Requirements:} 3 Strength\\
\textbf{Maneuver, Active, Repeatable, Source(100 Gold)}\\
When making a melee weapon attack based on Strength, you can pay 5 Stamina and reduce your attack roll by up to 3 and add that value to the damage. For example, if your weapon would deal 2D4 damage and you had 8 Strength, you could pay 5 Stamina and reduce your attack roll by up to 2, changing the weapon's damage to 2d4+2.\\
When using this weapon with a two-handed attack, the damage increase is doubled.\\
