\chapter*{Runes}	

Runes are a written symbol that holds the ability to shape magical energy to fit a certain element or create certain manifestations.\\
A magic-user can wield runes by etching them into rocks, putting them into writing, or creating tattoos on their own bodies. They can then channel Mana through the rune and create magical effects from them.\\
Each Rune has 3 Levels of understanding that can be mastered, and allows its user to create and manipulate the Rune's Element in some way when just wielding it.\\
Additionally, Spells are comprised of strange and arcane formulae, which are represented in written Form by assembling Runes. Therefore, in order to learn and master a Spell, a Mage has to also understand the underlying Runes. This is represented by the respective Requirements of each Spell in the Spells Section.

\section{Circles}
There are 14 runes in the Ragged Lands, and they are organized within circles. These circles contain multiple similar, but opposed elements . The two exceptions are the Arcana Rune, which produces a form of enhancement or type-less base energy, as well as the Nil Rune, which produces elemental nothingness, since this Element is opposed to all other elements except the pure and unchanged Arcana. The Arcana Rune is part of its own circle, while the Nil Rune is part of all 4 other Circles.\\

Learning and understanding multiple Runes in the same Circle is difficult thanks to the opposing elements that they hold. A Spellcaster has to wrap their Head around Elemental concepts that are directly opposed to each other.\\

As a result, when calculating the CP Costs of learning a new Rune, the costs of the new Rune Level are based on the total amount of Rune Levels already gained for this Circle.\\

This means that the costs for learning the next level of the Nil rune equal the costs for learning a rune in the circle where the caster has learned the least amount of runes.\\

However, it also means that learning a new level of the Nil rune increases the cost of learning runes in all 4 Circles.\\

The Circles and their respective Runes are:
