\section{Green Odem Flame}
\textbf{Cost:} 500 CP\\
\textbf{Requirements:} Odem I\\
\textbf{Active, Repeatable}\\
While being calm, you can call forth the power of compassion inside of you, producing a green, flame-like substance from your hands.\\
Any melee weapon attacks you do while this flame is active deal an additional 2d4+2 radiation damage.\\
When dealing this radiation damage, you gain the same amount as temporary Health. You can take 2 AP and touch a willing creature, redistributing as many of your temporary Hit Points as you want to them. Any temporary Hit Points gained in this fashion are reduced first, and when you stop being calmed they disappear.\\
However, whenever making a melee weapon attack or redistribute temporary Hit Points, you also must make an Empathy check against a Difficulty Value of 15. If you succeed, the Difficulty value increases by 2 for the next check. If you fail, you lose 1d6+5 Balance Points. You stop producing the flame when you stop being calmed.\\
