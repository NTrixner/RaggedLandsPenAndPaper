\section{Arcane Armor}
\textbf{Cost:} 100 Gold\\
\textbf{Requirements:} -\\
\textbf{Element:} Empty\\
\textbf{Spell, Active, Repeatable, Source, Memory}\\
For 8 AP and 5 Mana, you create a visible, magical force field around your body that increases your Armor Reduction by 2 against Cutting, Piercing and Blunt Damage. The force field can be active for up to your Intellect in hours. You donâ€™t need to concentrate on the spell. However, every time you take damage, even if it is reduced to 0 by your total Armor Reduction, you lose 2 Mana in order to keep up the spell. You can benefit from only one Arcane Armor at a time.\\
\\
If you apply an element to this spell, the armor instead grants resistance against that damage type, reducing it by half.\\
