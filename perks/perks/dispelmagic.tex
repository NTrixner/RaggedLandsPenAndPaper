\textbf{Cost:} 250 Gold\\
\textbf{Requirements:} Arcane Training I\\
\textbf{Element:} Nihil\\
\textbf{Spell, Active, Source, Memory, Repeatable}\\
You spend 4 AP and 10 Mana to dispel an active magical effect on a creature or item. This can include the equipment a creature is wearing, runes, magical circles etc. If your target is affected by multiple magical effects, the magical effect to be dispelled is chosen randomly. Make an Intellect check contested by the Intellect check from the target effect's creator. If the creator had arcane or elemental training congruent with the effect's element upon creation, they can add their level and d4s respectively. If you succeed, the spell's effect ends. If the effect was temporary, such as a spell's effect, it ends completely. If it was permanent, such as an enchantment, it is instead deactivated for 10 minutes, after which the effect starts working again.\\
