\textbf{Element:}: Light\\
\textbf{Spell, Active, Source, Memory}\\
For 10 AP and 5 Mana, you create a small, incorporeal ball of bright light above or beside your head, or you make a small object, not bigger than a tenth of a passus in diameter, shine a bright light. In either case, the light is no source of heat.\\
\\
The ball or object then shine a bright light to a range of 6 passus. Keeping the light up costs 1 mana per hour, but doesn't cost your concentration.\\
\\
The duration of this light is until you dismiss it, but to a maximum of hours equals to your Intellect. If you are trained in light magic, you can add your Adventuring Level to that value. On higher levels of light magic training, add 2 or 3 additional hours respectively.\\
\\
The light's colour can be changed whenever you want.\\
