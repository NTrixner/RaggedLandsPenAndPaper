\textbf{Requirements:} -\\
\textbf{Spell, Active, Source(20 Gold), Memory}\\
For 10 AP and 5 Mana, you create a small, incorporeal ball of bright light above or beside your head, or you make a small object, not bigger than a tenth of a passus in diameter, shine a bright light. In either case, the light is no source of heat.\\
\\
The ball or object then shines a bright light to a range of 5 + your adventuring level passus.\\
\\
Keeping the light up costs 1 mana per hour, but doesn't cost your concentration. You can keep it until you dismiss it or fall unconscious or die, but to a maximum of hours equals to your Intellect.
\\
The light's colour can be changed whenever you want.\\
