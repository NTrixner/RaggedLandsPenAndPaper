You cast a spell for 25 Mana and 6 AP and then target a creature of your choice that you can see (you can also target yourself). If the creature isnâ€™t willing, it can try to resist you. Make an IN check contested by its own IN check. If you win, it is inflicted by one of two possible conditions: hastened or hindered. This condition applies for a duration of 1 minute. You decide which condition to apply when casting the spell. If a creature can identify your spell while you cast, it can discern which condition you are creating.\\
\\
While being hastened, the Action Points of any action are halved, to a minimum of 1.\\
\\
While being hindered, the Action Points of any action are doubled.\\
