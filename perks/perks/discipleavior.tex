\section{Disciple of Avior}
\textbf{Cost:} 0 CP\\
\textbf{Requirements:} - \\
\textbf{Passive, Repeatable}\\
You are a disciple of Avior. You gain 5 Piety Points. Using a prayer requires you to have a certain amount of Piety Points. Using a Wonder reduces your Piety Points. When you lose enough Piety Points to not be able to use a prayer, this does not mean that you also lose that prayer perk. Instead, you just lose the ability to use it until you have enough Piety points again.\\
\\
Avior is the god of humankind, civilization, huntsmen, war, farming, the sun and the hearth. You gain Piety Points by performing certain activities. Whenever an activity states to kill a certain creature, it also assumes that you can help killing that creature (by being part of a fight against it) or change the creature into something else (e.g. "Kill a criminal" could also mean arresting them and making sure they are punished and change their ways)\\
