\textbf{Cost:} 500 CP\\
\textbf{Requirements:} -\\
\textbf{Element:} Light\\
\textbf{Spell, Active, Source(200 Gold), Repeatable, Memory}\\
For 4 AP and 10 Mana, you become invisible. This requires your concentration. If you perform any other action than moving - opening a door, attacking a creature, consuming a potion etc. - while being invisible, you need to pay one Mana per AP of that action, otherwise the invisibility ends.\\
Invisibility improves your ability to sneak. Whenever you try to move stealthily while being invisible, you can roll twice, taking the higher result. Any attack roll against an invisible creature is reduced by 10.\\

Level Progression:\\
II: 1000 CP, You can affect other creatures. You have to touch them to do this, but if they're not willing they can not resist you. Keeping the effect up doesn't take your concentration, but you cannot keep the effect active if they perform an action other than moving.\\
III: 5000 CP, You can pay 25 Mana instead, and don't have to keep the effect active when you perform any action other than moving. If you're casting the spell in this way, you can only affect yourself with it.\\
