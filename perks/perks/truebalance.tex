Pray for 6 AP. Choose a creature that you can see. Roll 3D6. You can reduce your own health by this amount, healing the target creature by the same amount. Or you can reduce the creature's health and heal that amount of health yourself instead. If the target creature isn't willing, they can make a EM check against your EM check to resist this effect.\\
