\chapter{Skills}
Skills are perks that represent a character's training in a certain area of ability and/or knowledge. They allow that character to add their level to a check related to that area. Higher levels in a perk allow them to add +1d4, +2d4 and +3d4 respectively. Skills are not bound to one certain activity, instead including knowledge about the topic and activities that relate to that area.
