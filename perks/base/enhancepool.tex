\section{Enhance Pool}\label{sec:enhancepool}
\textbf{Cost:} 500 CP\\
\textbf{Requirements:} -\\
\textbf{Passive, Repeatable}\\
Choose a pool value.
Whenever you gain a rank in the "Increase" Perk for that pool value (Increase Health, Increase Stamina or Increase Mana), the amount of points you gain is increased by one die size (from 1d6 to 1d8 to 1d10 to a maximum of 1d12).
Don't re-roll previous ranks of the "Increase" Perk for that pool value.
Instead, you gain 1 point for each rank of "Increase" you already have for that pool value.
Additionally, your regeneration factor is increased by 1 (for Mana, you roll twice, thrice or four times per hour respectively).\\
Whenever you gain another rank of this perk, you choose the pool value to enhance.
No one pool value can be enhanced more than 3 times
