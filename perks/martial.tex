\chapter{Martial Training}\label{ch:martialTraining}
This category includes training with weapons and armor.
If you would profit from multiple bonuses at the same time (Like weapon training (Arming Sword) II and Sword Training I), you only add the highest bonus.
(In this case, Weapon Training (Arming Sword) II while wielding an Arming Sword)Â´.
This applies to every single bonus that you gain from each perk.
For example, wearing a piece of cloth under your heavy armor while being proficient with both adds the bonuses to Dodge, while also increasing Damage Reduction.
