You can spend 2 additional AP to create an opening in your opponent's defenses, to be able to hit easier. When making a melee weapon attack, make an Empathy check adding bonuses for deception, contested by the defender's Notice and Perception check (adding bonuses for recognizing deceptions). If your Empathy check succeeds, the defender has to take the hit. This counts for the prerequisite of a Sneak Attack. If you don't succeed, the defender can react as usual.\\
