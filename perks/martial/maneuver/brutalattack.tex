\textbf{Cost:} 100 CP\\
\textbf{Requirements:} 3 Strength\\
\textbf{Maneuver, Active, Repeatable, Source(100 Gold)}\\
When making a melee weapon attack based on Strength, you can pay 5 Stamina and suffer a Skill Malus to that Attack of up to -3, while gaining a Skill Bonus to Weapon Damage equal to the same amount, but positive.
For example, if your weapon would deal 2D4 damage, and you had 8 Strength, you could pay 5 Stamina and Suffer a Skill Malus to the attack roll of -2, changing the weapon's damage to 2d4+2.\\
When using this weapon with a two-handed weapon attack, the Skill Damage bonus is doubled.\\
