You can spend 2 additional AP to create an opening in your opponent's defenses, to be able to hit easier.
When making a melee weapon attack, make an Empathy check adding bonuses for deception, contested by the defender's Notice.
If your roll is above the defender's maximum Notice, the target can not react to your attack.
If the defender makes a Notice check and succeeds, their Dodge (as well as Maximum and Minimum Dodge) suffers a Distraction Malus equals to your Deception Roll minus their Minimum Notice.
If your Deception roll is below their minimum Notice, the target can react normally.\\
