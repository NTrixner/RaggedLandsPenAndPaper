\textbf{Maneuver, Active, Repeatable, Source(150 Gold)}\\
You can spend 2 AP to provoke an Opponent to attack you.
Make an Empathy check, contested by this opponent's Perception check.
If you succeed, this opponent suffers a Skill Malus Modifier of \sfrac{1}{2} to Damage rolls against creatures that aren't you for its next 1d6 attacks.
This excludes area of effect damage that includes you (meaning, if the creature would deal damage against multiple targets, and you are one of these targets, all targets take full damage)\\
