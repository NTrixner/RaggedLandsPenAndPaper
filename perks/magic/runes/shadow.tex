\subsubsection{Shadow form}
You cast for 3 AP and 5 Mana, and your shadow rises from the ground and envelops your body.
While you are in this form, any attack roll that would hit you has 50\% chance of hitting your shadow instead of you.
Once the shadow is hit, it disappears and becomes your normal shadow again.
The Shadow Form ends either way after 1 hour, and can be dismissed at any time.
