\subsubsection{Geomancy}
For 4 AP and 5 Mana, you can start moving the earth surrounding you.
Any mineral compound with loose texture (Mud, Dirt, Sand, Clay) in a radius of~\passus{4} of you can be moved.
Doing so takes 1 Mana per Minute, and you can move a mass equal to 1 Stone (6 kg, 13 lb) per Minute.

\subsubsection{Hurl Rock}
For 5 AP and 8 Mana you move a rock from the ground and hurl it at an enemy in a range of \passus{6}.
Make a ranged spell attack.
On a hit, the target takes 1d12 blunt damage.
Additionally, if the target took damage from the rock, it is moved away from you by \passus{1} per point of damage it actually took.
