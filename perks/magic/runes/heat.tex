\subsection{Level 1 Abilities}

\subsubsection{Flame Hand}
For 2 AP and 8 Mana, you create a small flame in your hands.
This flame costs 1 Mana per Minute to keep burning, and sheds bright light in a radius of \passus{2} and dim light for an additional \passus{2} beyond that.
While holding the flame, flammable things that you touch with it start to ignite.
For 2 AP, you can hurl the flame.
It travels for a distance of up to \passus{12}.
If you hurl the flame at a creature, make a ranged spell attack.
On a hit, the flame deals 1d10 heat damage.
The flame in your hand ends if you hurl it.
