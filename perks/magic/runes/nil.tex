\subsection{Rank I Abilities}

\subsubsection{Antimagic}
When you are targeted by a spell or rune attack that would deal damage to you, you can use your Nil Rune to block that attack.
Doing so requires a block roll that uses your IN, as well as an amount of Mana (instead of Stamina) equal to 2 per AP that the Attacker used.
If you succeed, you reduce the spell or rune damage dealt by 1d6.
The amount blocked like this improves from the~\nameref{perk:runepowertraining} perk.
This action counts as a defensive Action for all other related perks.

\subsubsection{Nihilation Bolt}
For 3 AP and 4 Mana you create a bolt of negative energy and hurl it at a target in a range of~\passus{6}.
Make a ranged spell attack.
On a hit, the target takes 2d6+2 nihilation damage.
