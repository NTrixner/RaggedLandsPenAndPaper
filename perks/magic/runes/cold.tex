\subsection{Level 1 Abilities}

\subsubsection{Ice Touch}
For 2 AP and 4 Mana you lower the temperature of your hand to a freezing point.
Keeping this effect up takes 1 Mana per AP.
When you touch an object or a creature, you can decide if you want to lower their temperature gradually or aggressively.
If you lower someone's or something's temperature gradually, you can do so at a rate of about 1 degree celsius or 1 Kelvin per 5 AP.
If you do so aggressively, make a melee spell attack against that target.
On a hit, the Ice Touch deals 2d4 cold damage and 2d4 Stamina damage.
