\subsection{Level 1 Abilities}

\subsubsection{Wind Gust}
For 2 AP and 2 Mana, you can create a small gust of wind in a range of \passus{12}.
This gust is strong enough to blow out candles, but makes larger fires only flicker.
You can also use it to move very light, small objects, like pieces of paper or feathers at a speed of \passus{1} per AP.
For every AP that you keep up this Wind Gust, you must pay 1 Mana.

\subsubsection{Air Blade}
For 3 AP and 5 Mana you create a Blade of Wind that travels in a straight line from your position to a target of your choice and has a range of \passus{6}.
Make a ranged spell attack against that target.
On a hit, the Air Blade deals 2d6 cutting damage.
