\subsubsection{Curative Touch}
For 2 AP and 4 Mana, your rune starts to faintly glow with life energy.
This Effect creates curative power of 4d4.
When you use 3 AP to touch a creature with this rune afterwards, you can spend any amount of those d4s to heal the creature by the amount rolled on the d4s.
If a creature is undead or not willing, you have to make a melee spell attack instead.
An undead is damaged by the healing of this rune instead.
