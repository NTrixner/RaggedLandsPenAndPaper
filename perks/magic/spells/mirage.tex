\textbf{Spell, Active, Source(50 Gold), Memory}\\
For 4 AP and 5 Mana, you create a mirage not larger than \passus{2} in every dimension.
Keeping the mirage up costs 1 mana per hour.
Changing the mirage costs 2 Mana, and requires you to see the mirage.
You can dismiss the mirage at any time, but it cannot be kept up any longer than your Intellect value in hours.\\
\\
The DV of spotting the illusion is determined by your Intellect check.
Roll once when creating the Mirage, and again whenever you change it. \\
\\
When a creature perceives the image, their Notice is targeted by the DV of the image.
If they succeed, they realize the true nature of the Illusion.
If they fail, they are fooled by the mirage.
If they roll and succeed, they don't realize the true nature of the Illusion, but realize that something is "off" about it.
Any creature interacting with the mirage instantly realize that the Mirage is fake.\\
