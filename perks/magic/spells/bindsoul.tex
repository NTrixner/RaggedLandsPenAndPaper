\section{Bind Soul}
\textbf{Cost:} 200 CP\\
\textbf{Requirements:}~\nameref{rune:nil} I, Any Anima Rune I except Nil\\
\textbf{Spell, Active, Repeatable, Source(100 Gold)}\\
You capture the soul of one recently deceased, non-humanoid creature by casting a spell that takes 12 AP and costs 5 Mana.
The spell only works up to 10 minutes after a creature's death, and a creature's soul can not be captured twice.
Casting this spell transforms a gem worth 50 gold or more into a tiny soul shard.\\
You can only capture a creature whose encounter rating is Tier 1.
The GM knows this statistic.
If the creature is above encounter rating Tier 1, the casting fails, and you lose your Mana.
At higher ranks of the spell, you may be able to capture creatures whose encounter rating is above Tier 1.
If you don't have enough Mana to capture the creature, you can decide at the threshold of each Tier if you want to abort casting the spell.\\
For example, you might have 25 Mana left, and are trying to capture a creature's soul whose encounter Rating is Tier 3.
You spend an initial 5 Mana, and the GM tells you that the creature wasn't Tier 1.
You decide to pay an additional 10 Mana, and the GM tells you that it wasn't Tier 2 either.
At this point, you would have to stop casting, since the next rank would drain you below 0 Mana.
