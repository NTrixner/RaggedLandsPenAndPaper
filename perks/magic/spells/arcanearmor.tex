You target one willing creature in a range of \passus{6} that you can see.
For 8 AP and 5 Mana, you create a visible, magical force field around that creature's body that increases its Armor Reduction by 2 against Blunt, Cutting, or Piercing Damage.
The force field can be active for up to your Intellect in hours.
Every time the creature would take Blunt, Cutting, or Piercing damage, even if it is reduced to 0 by their total Armor Reduction, you lose 2 Mana in order to keep up the spell.
One creature can benefit from only one Arcane Armor at a time.\\
\\
Level Progression:\\
\\
II: 350 CP, 10 Mana for 4 Armor Reduction\\
III: 750 CP, 15 Mana for 6 Armor Reduction\\
IV: 1500 CP, 20 Mana for 8 Armor Reduction\\
V: 5000 CP, 25 Mana for 10 Armor Reduction\\

\subsection{Variation: Elemental Armor}\label{spell:elementalArmor}
\textbf{Cost:} 50 CP\\
\textbf{Requirements:} -\\
When casting Elemental Armor instead of Arcane Armor, the armor instead grants Armor Reduction against elemental damage types.
Pay the initial casting cost for each damage type that the Elemental Armor should defend against.\\
For example, a level II Elemental Armor that defends against Heat and Cold, the initial casting cost would be 20 Mana, and it would grant Heat and Cold Resistance 4.\\
A creature can benefit from multiple different Elemental and Arcane Armors at a time, but the effects don't stack.
Instead, only the highest gained Damage Reduction per Damage Type applies.
