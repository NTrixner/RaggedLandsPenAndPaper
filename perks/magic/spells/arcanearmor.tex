\subsection{Variation: Elemental Armor}\label{spell:elementalArmor}
\textbf{Cost:} 50 CP\\
\textbf{Requirements:} -\\
When casting Elemental Armor instead of Arcane Armor, the armor instead grants Armor Reduction against elemental damage types.
Pay the initial and upkeep casting cost for each damage type that the Elemental Armor should defend against.\\
For example, a rank II Elemental Armor that defends against Heat and Cold, the initial casting cost would be 20 Mana, the hourly cost would be 4, and it would grant a +4 Arcane Bonus to Damage Reduction against Heat and Cold damage.\\
You can also combine multiple Ranks of Elemental Armor in a single casting, but not Elemental Armor and Arcane Armor.\\
