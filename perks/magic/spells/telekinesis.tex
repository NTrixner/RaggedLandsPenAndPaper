\textbf{Cost:} 100 CP\\
\textbf{Requirements:}~\nameref{rune:air} I,~\nameref{rune:arcana} I\\
\textbf{Spell, Active, Source (50 Gold), Repeatable, Memory}\\
You spend 6 AP and 5 Mana to slightly lift a remote object or creature that is the equivalent of one small or smaller object.
If you are targeting a creature, it can try to resist.
If it does so, make an IN check targeting its Willpower.
You can move the lifted entity around freely in the air, taking 1 Mana and 1 AP per \passus{1} moved.
You can also just keep it in the air, which doesn't cost you AP or Mana.\\
The effect ends when you decide to, or when you lose sight of the entity.
Another person can try to also control the same entity.
If they are doing so manually, they make a Strength check (adding bonuses for unarmed combat) contested by your Intellect check.
If they also try to manipulate the object with a Telekinesis spell, you make opposing Intellect checks.
If you lose, the spell also ends and the other person gains control of the entity.\\
\\
Rank Progression:\\

Also, moving lifted items that are small or smaller doesn't cost additional Mana anymore.\\

IV: 2,500 CP, 30 initial Mana for an extra-large object.
Also, moving lifted items that are medium or smaller doesn't cost additional Mana anymore.
