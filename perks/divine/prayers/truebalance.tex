\textbf{Requirements:} Disciple of a Ebron, 3 Piety Points \\
\textbf{Active, Prayer, Weapon, Repeatable, Source(50 Gold)}\\
Pray for 4 AP and choose a creature that you can see.
You can reduce your own health 2D6, healing the target creature by the rolled amount.
Or you can deal 2D6 necrotic damage to the target creature, and heal yourself by the dealt damage.
If the target creature isn't willing, make an empathy check.\\
If the target creature's willpower is below your empathy, your prayer fails.
If it is above, the creature can half value that it is affected by, by making a Vitality check against your Empathy check.
If they resist, you can transfer only half the amount of health.\\
