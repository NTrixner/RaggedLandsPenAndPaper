\section{Thorn Shot}\label{prayer:thornShot}
\textbf{Cost:} 100 CP\\
\textbf{Requirements:} Disciple of a Irani, 3 Piety Points \\
\textbf{Active, Prayer, Weapon, Repeatable, Source(50 Gold)}\\
Pray for 4 AP. Make a ranged weapon attack against a creature of your choice in a \passus{12} radius.
A thorn grows on the palm of your hand and shoots forward, hitting the creature.
The thorn deals 1D8 piercing damage.
If the creature is a humanoid, the thorn deals 1d10 damage instead.
If the creature is a construct, the thorn deals 1d12 damage instead.
If the creature is dealt any damage, make an Empathy check, contested by the creature's Strength check.
If you succeed, the creature becomes bound by a growth of vines growing from the point of impact.
While being bound, a creature can not move.
To remove the vines, the target must spend 1 AP for every point of damage that they took from the original thorn.
Other creatures can help the target, but must stand next to it to do so, and also spend AP.
